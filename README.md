# Fantasy-Football-Model

## Overview
This project involves building a comprehensive predictive model for 2024 fantasy football points. The model was engineered using Python, leveraging eight years of web-scraped historical data. The project includes end-to-end data scraping, cleaning, preprocessing, machine learning model development, and the creation of a user-friendly web application to display predictions.

## Features
- **Data Scraping & Cleaning**: Scraped historical fantasy football data from various sources on the web. Cleaned and preprocessed the data for analysis and model training.
- **Database Integration**: Efficiently stored cleaned data in an SQLite database.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed machine learning models using Scikit-learn and PyTorch, optimized performance based on Mean Squared Error (MSE), and selected the top-performing model for predictions.
- **Web Application**: Built and deployed a full-stack web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app displays player predictions in a dashboard that allows users to navigate statistics by player position (QB, WR, RB, TE).
